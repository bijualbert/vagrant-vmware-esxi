vagrant-vmware-esxi plugin
==========================
This is a Vagrant plugin that adds a VMware ESXi provider support.  This allows Vagrant to control and provision VMs directly on an ESXi hypervisor without a need for vCenter or VShpere.   ESXi hypervisor is a free download from VMware!

Vagrant vs Terraform.
---------------------
If you are using vagrant as a deployment tool (infra as code), you may want to consider a better tool:  Terraform.  Vagrant is better for development environments, while Terraform is better at managing infrastructure.  Please give my Terraform plugin a try and give me some feedback.  What you're trying to do, what's missing, what works, what doesn't work, etc...

Features and Compatibility
--------------------------
* Clone from VMs.  (see wiki)  Clone a VM on the ESXi host instead of transferring a box stored on your local pc.
* Any of the vmware Box formats should be compatible.
  * vmware_desktop, vmware_fusion, vmware_workstation...
  * To be fully functional, you must have open-vm-tools or vmware tools installed.
* Will automatically download boxes from the web.
* Will automatically upload the box to your ESXi host.
* Automatic or manual VM names.
  * Automatic VM names are 'PREFIX-HOSTNAME-USERNAME-DIR'.
* Multi machine capable.
* Supports adding your VM to Resource Pools to partition CPU and memory usage from other VMs on your ESXi host.
* suspend, resume, snapshots.
* rsync & NFS using built-in Vagrant synced folders.
* Provision using built-in Vagrant provisioner.
* package your VMs into boxes.
* Create additional network interfaces, set nic type, MAC addresses, static IPs.
* Use Vagrants private_network, public_network options to set a static IP addresses on additional network interfaces.  (not the primary interface)
* Disks can be provisioned using thin, thick or eagerzeroedthick.
* Create additional guest storage (up to 14 virtual disks).
* Specify GuestOS types, virtual HW version.
* Any custom vmx settings can be added or modified.


Requirements
------------
1. This is a vagrant plugin, so you need vagrant installed...  :-)
2. This plugin requires ovftool from VMware.  Download from VMware website.  NOTE: ovftool installer for windows doesn't put ovftool.exe in your path.  You can manually set your path, or install ovftool in the \HashiCorp\Vagrant\bin directory.
>https://www.vmware.com/support/developer/ovf/
3. You MUST enable ssh access on your ESXi hypervisor.
  * Google 'How to enable ssh access on ESXi'
4. The boxes must have open-vm-tools or vmware-tools installed to properly transition to the 'running' state.
5. In general, you should know how to use vagrant, esxi and some networking...
6. You will most likely need a DHCP server on your primary network if you are deploying public boxes.

Why this plugin?
----------------
Not everyone has vCenter / vSphere...  vCenter cost $$$.  ESXi is free!
Using this plugin will allow you to use a central VMware ESXi host for your development needs.  Using a centralized host will release the extra load on your local system (vs using KVM or Virtual Box).

How to install
--------------
Download and install Vagrant on your local system using instructions from https://vagrantup.com/downloads.html.   
```
vagrant plugin install vagrant-vmware-esxi
vagrant plugin list
vagrant version
```
How to use and configure a Vagrantfile
--------------------------------------

1. cd SOMEDIR
1. `vagrant init`
1. `vi Vagrantfile`  # Replace the contents of Vagrantfile with the following example. Specify parameters to access your ESXi host, guest and local preferences.
```ruby
#
#  Fully documented Vagrantfile available
#  in the wiki:  https://github.com/bijualbert/vagrant-vmware-esxi/wiki
Vagrant.configure('2') do |config|

  #  Box, Select any box created for VMware that is compatible with
  #    the ovftool.  To get maximum compatibility You should download
  #    and install the latest version of ovftool for your OS.
  #    https://www.vmware.com/support/developer/ovf/
  #
  #    If your box is stuck at 'Powered On', then most likely
  #    the box/vm doesn't have the vmware tools installed.
  #
  # Here are some of the MANY examples....
  config.vm.box = 'hashicorp/precise64'
  #config.vm.box = 'generic/centos7'
  #config.vm.box = 'generic/centos6'
  #config.vm.box = 'generic/fedora27'
  #config.vm.box = 'generic/freebsd11'
  #config.vm.box = 'generic/ubuntu1710'
  #config.vm.box = 'generic/debian9'
  #config.vm.box = 'steveant/CentOS-7.0-1406-Minimal-x64'
  #config.vm.box = 'geerlingguy/centos7'
  #config.vm.box = 'geerlingguy/ubuntu1604'
  #config.vm.box = 'laravel/homestead'
  #config.vm.box = 'puphpet/debian75-x64'


  #  Use rsync and NFS synced folders. (or use the option to disable them)
  #    https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/synced-folders/
  #config.vm.synced_folder('.', '/vagrant', type: 'rsync')
  config.vm.synced_folder('.', '/vagrant', type: 'nfs', disabled: true)

  #  Vagrant can configure additional network interfaces using a static IP or
  #  DHCP. Use public_network or private_network to manually set a static IP and
  #  optionally netmask.  ESXi doesn't use the concept of public or private
  #  networks so both are valid here.  The primary network interface is considered the
  #  "vagrant management" interface and cannot be changed and this plugin
  #  supports 10 NICS, so you can specify 9 entries here!
  #
  #  https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/networking/public_network.html
  #  https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/networking/private_network.html
  #
  #    *** Invalid settings could cause 'vagrant up' to fail ***
  #config.vm.network 'private_network', ip: '192.168.10.170', netmask: '255.255.255.0'
  #config.vm.network 'private_network', ip: '192.168.11.170'

    #  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!  ESXi Virtual Network
    #    You should specify an ESXi Virtual Network!  If it's not specified, the
    #    default is to use the first found.  You can specify up to 10 virtual

    #    Vagrant can use any stopped VM as the source 'box'.   The VM must be
    #    registered, stopped and must have the vagrant insecure ssh key installed.
    #    If the VM is stored in a resource pool, it must be specified.

Basic usage
-----------
1. `vagrant up --provider=vmware_esxi`
1. To access the VM, use `vagrant ssh`
1. To destroy the VM, use `vagrant destroy`
1. Some other fun stuff you can do.
  * `vagrant status`
  * `vagrant suspend`
  * `vagrant resume`
  * `vagrant ssh-config`
  * `vagrant snapshot push`
  * `vagrant snapshot list`
  * `vagrant snapshot-info`   # esxi provided plugin. Output snapshot information/tree.
  * `vagrant snapshot pop`  
  * `vagrant halt`
  * `vagrant provision`
  * `vagrant address`   # ESXi provided plugin. Output IP address of guest.



Known issues with vmware_esxi
-----------------------------
* The boxes must have open-vm-tools or vmware-tools installed to properly transition to the 'running' state.
* Invalid settings (bad IP address, netmask, MAC address, guest_custom_vmx_settings) could cause 'vagrant up' to fail.  Review vSphere console and/or ESXi logs to help debug why it failed.
* If you break an install ([CTRL]-C), the cleanup task doesn't always destroy the VM that has been partially built.  To resolve this, use the local_allow_overwrite = 'True' Vagrantfile option if you want to force a rebuild, or you can delete the vm using the vSphere client.
* ovftool installer for Windows doesn't put ovftool.exe in your path.  You can manually set your path, or install ovftool in the \HashiCorp\Vagrant\bin directory.
* Vagrant NFS synced folders cannot not be 100% reliable on multi-homed clients (your Vagrant pc/laptop/host).  There is no 100% reliable way to know which IP is the correct, most reliable, most desirable, way to reach the VM guest.
* Plugin V2.0.1 - 2.0.5 is not compatible with Windows (to support ed25519 ssh keys, net-ssh requires libsodium but it's not compatible with Windows).  ed25519 support has been removed for now.   It will be added back when net-ssh 5.x goes out of beta.
* Vagrant 2.1.0 is not compatible with this plugin. Avoid Vagrant 2.1.0.
* Cygwin & gitbash have console issues. Ruby module io/console does not have support.  https://github.com/ruby/io-console/issues/2
* Setting the hostname on some boxes can cause 'vagrant up' to fail if the network configuration wasn't previously cleaned up.  Avoid buggy boxes, fix the box networking and repackage, or do not set the hostname via Vagrant.
